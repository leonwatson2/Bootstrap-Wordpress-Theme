#LW_Designs Theme
===


LW_Designs [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) theme was just me getting use to how to make
a wordpress theme using bootstrap as a framework. I used 
[underscores](http://underscores.me) for the framework of the WordPress theme 
and then designed the rest.

It is currently what I am using for my Freelance website [LWDesigns](http://vlw2.com)
which will be updated into an entirely new theme soon! :D
